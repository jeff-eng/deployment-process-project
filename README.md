# Hosting a Full-Stack Application

## Overview
Udagram is a full-stack image filtering web application, which allows users to register and log into a web client, post photos to the feed, and process photos using an image filtering service.

Udagram has two components:
1. Front-end - Angular web application built with Ionic framework
2. Backend - RESTful API built with Node-TypeScript

The purpose of this project is learning to configure a CI/CD pipeline using CircleCI to deploy the pre-built Udagram application to AWS cloud services.
